- With Git, your project structure is *always* clean like below.
- You *always* work on the latest version of the files.
*** Have as many versions as you want

In fact, Git encourages you to break your changes into small coherent chunks
as incremental versions.

Each line below can be considred as a version.
** Understand your work

With Git, you understand how your 
- paper
- code
- data
evolve over time in retrospect.
** Full cooperation history
Know who changed what at when & why - line by line.
** Time travel to any version
Time travel to previous versions with /zero/ damage to current work.
** Work on new ideas - no worries
Experiment with new ideas in place with *zero* commitment.
** Bring sub-projects up to speed with one command
Update your conference slides to use the newest changes in main paper, with *zero* manual check-copy-paste.
** Sub-projects live together yet separately
Change code for your conference slides with *zero* damage to your main paper code.
